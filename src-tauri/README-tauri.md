# src-tauri


This directory contains scripts and things to bundle Mondat as a standalone desktop application.


## Building
Nothing in the src-tauri directory should affect the normal development of Mondat as a Nuxt application. Rather, it takes the standard web files generated by Nuxt and bundles them into a standalone executable.

You create the bundle by running these commands in the root directory for MONDAT:

    yarn build
    yarn generate
    yarn tauri build

The output is a dmg file for distribution, with a name like this:

`src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/dmg/mondat_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`

Alternatively, the executable can be run directly from the command line:

`src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/macos/mondat.app/Contents/MacOS/mondat`

The command __yarn tauri build --debug__ creates a version of the application including the WebView debug console, which can be accessed by right clicking on the screen and selecting _Inspect Element_.

**Note from Phil:** At the time of writing (March 2022) a bug prevented the Javascript console from being displayed on my M1 Macbook Pro. I don't know if this occurs on other platforms.
